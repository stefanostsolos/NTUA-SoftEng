  <h3 align="center"> NTUA SoftEng - Toll Interoperability </h3>

</p>


## About the Project

This project was developed by our team as part of the SoftEng course, during the 7th semester of the Electrical and Computer Engineering school of the National Technical University of Athens. The Toll Interoperability Service System aims to address the growing need for seamless toll payment across the Greek highway network. With seven different motorway operators and an expanding network of toll stations, this system facilitates the use of a single electronic card (e-pass) for all highways, enhancing user convenience and reducing wait times.

Key objectives:
- Record debts between motorway operators from vehicle crossings
- Offset debts and manage payments between operators
- Present crossing data to operators and transport authorities
- Ensure accurate and complete debt recording
- Facilitate debt offsetting on operator request
- Confirm successful payments through payment service providers

### Repository contents

This repository contains the cumulative work produced to develop this project. Specifically, the `api` directory contains a REST API specification, compliant with OpenAPI 3.0. The `backend` directory contains all the code for the backend application, while the `cli` directory contains the code for the CLI. The `frontend` directory contains all the code for the front-end application. The `database` directory contains a dump of the MySQL database. The `doc` directory contains documents related to the requirements specifications of the project, along with a Visual Paradigm file containing diagrams. The `test-api` and `test-backend` contain the Postman collection about API and Backend tests respectively. Finally, the `test-cli` contains unit and functional tests for the CLI module.

### Interfaces

#### External System Interfaces

The software interfaces with:

1. **Operator Crossing Management Systems**: To retrieve real-time crossing data (e.g., e-card ID, vehicle details)
2. **Operator Registration Systems**: To update the software's database with new vehicles, e-cards, and toll stations
3. **Payment Service Providers**: To receive debt settlement confirmations
4. **Third-party Authentication Systems**: For user identification upon system entry

#### User Interfaces

A web application accessible via standard web browsers, providing:

For Operators:
- User authentication
- Vehicle crossing analysis
- Debt management and analysis
- Debt settlement configuration
- Traffic statistics viewing and download

For Transport Authorities:
- User authentication
- Traffic statistics viewing and download
