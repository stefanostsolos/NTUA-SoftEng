# Toll Interoperability Service System

## Introduction

### Purpose of the Software

The Toll Interoperability Service System aims to address the growing need for seamless toll payment across the Greek highway network. With seven different motorway operators and an expanding network of toll stations, this system facilitates the use of a single electronic card (e-pass) for all highways, enhancing user convenience and reducing wait times.

Key objectives:
- Record debts between motorway operators from vehicle crossings
- Offset debts and manage payments between operators
- Present crossing data to operators and transport authorities
- Ensure accurate and complete debt recording
- Facilitate debt offsetting on operator request
- Confirm successful payments through payment service providers

### Interfaces

#### External System Interfaces

The software interfaces with:

1. **Operator Crossing Management Systems**: To retrieve real-time crossing data (e.g., e-card ID, vehicle details)
2. **Operator Registration Systems**: To update the software's database with new vehicles, e-cards, and toll stations
3. **Payment Service Providers**: To receive debt settlement confirmations
4. **Third-party Authentication Systems**: For user identification upon system entry

#### User Interfaces

A web application accessible via standard web browsers, providing:

For Operators:
- User authentication
- Vehicle crossing analysis
- Debt management and analysis
- Debt settlement configuration
- Traffic statistics viewing and download

For Transport Authorities:
